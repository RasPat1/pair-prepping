# How to run ras' code.

I'll be writing my code in ruby. Typically, just run the code with `ruby filename.rb`.
To avoid any issues with different ruby versions you can try this docker command as well.
I may start using dependencies as well so we can make a separate bin with a shell command.
That shell command will bundle the gem dependencies and run the code.
Do these come with test suites? How can we run them again a test suite in a PR or locally?
Do I have to copy the code into LC every time to validate? Probably, let's start with that.

## TODO

- Add ability to run via docker to avoid ruby version issues and make life easier for runner
- Add ability to use gems. (Probably, just for test suites)
- Add ability to run tests with test suite provided by LC?
